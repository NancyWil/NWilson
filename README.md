I hate lies. Sincere, humble, gentle. I'm a quiet, down-to-earth woman, who's organized and neat. I prefer relationships that are traditional and structured. I take my responsibilities seriously; you can count on me - I'm loyal, hard-working, and patient. I'm also quite private and consistent in my habits.
